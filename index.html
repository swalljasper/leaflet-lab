					<h2>Chicago's South Side</h2>
					<p>In 2012 the FBI named Chicago, IL America's murder capital. This was no surprise to many Americans. The "South Side" has had connotations of violent crime for years prior to the diagnosis.</p>
					<p>This map doesn't set out to test the FBI's, theory, but to help remedy the problem by finding specific spatial and temporal patterns. Violent crime of this nature has a way of being elusive.</p> 
					<p>As we can see, there are not specific neighborhoods or even districts that homicides are concentrated in. The spatial and temporal patterns evolve over time. We can see that the total amount of murders stays relatively similar over time. The neighborhood with the most murders is a moving target, which makes the problem extremely hard to police.</p>
